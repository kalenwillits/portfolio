  I am a jovial Software Developer that thrives on innovative and quality creations.
  <br>
  <br>
  My experience is in <nobr style="color:rgb(14 165 233)">Data Engineering</nobr>, <nobr style="color:rgb(217 70 239)">Full Stack</nobr>, and <nobr style="color:rgb(244 63 94)">Video Game</nobr> development. I hold an <nobr style="color:rgb(34 197 94)">Associates Degree</nobr> from the University of Hawaii
  with a certification in  data science from Springboard. My best work is building data-centric Python applications leveraging the Django or Pandas frameworks, but
  I am also a well-rounded web developer using Next.js. Additionally I am a capable Data Engineer where I have deployed production level event-driven data pipelines to GCP, AWS, and Snowflake providing robust buisness-critical analytics.
  <br>
  <br>
  Recently I embarked on a new journey founding the indie game studio <nobr style="color:rgb(244 63 94)"> <a href="https://www.darkmode.games/">Dark Mode Games</a> </nobr> where we use a fully open source tech stack to develop community-driven content. This is where I get to practice being a lead in agile project management using C++ and the Godot game engine.
