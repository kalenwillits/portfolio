  Fluent in <nobr style="color:rgb(13 165 233)">Python</nobr>, using the <nobr style="color:rgb(14 165 233)">Python</nobr> data stack deployed to event-based cloud
  functions and containers as serverless data pipelines across a variety of
  platforms such as <nobr style="color:#f58e0b">AWS</nobr>, <nobr style="color:#10b981">GCP</nobr>, Snowflake and more. Holding Springboardâ€™s Data

	Latest work includes developing extractors and connectors for custom client
	pipelines using <nobr style="color:rgb(13 165 233)">Python</nobr> and <nobr
	style="color:#f42f5e">Rust</nobr> programming languages. By using <nobr style="color:#f43f5e">Rust</nobr>,
	data driven applications receive increases to dependability, security, and performance 
	thanks to the langauge's idea of "borrowing" pointers and strict static typing. Some metrics show up to a 
	ten times faster application runtime with a lower memory foot print than <nobr style="color:rgb(13 165 233)">Python</nobr>
	allowing for smaller memory allocations across serverless architectures.
